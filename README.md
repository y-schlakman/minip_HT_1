# minip_HT_1
An implementation of a 3D scene renderer that uses ray tracing along with the Phong reflection model.

The renderer allows for creation of scenes consisting of colored two and three dimensional geometric shapes, and setting their placement in three dimensional space.
The model uses the phong reflection model as well as ray tracing methods for realistic looking scenes.
In addition, we've implemented a gloss effect that can be enabled and personalized for reflective objects, as well as a diffuse option that can be enabled and personalized for see-through objects.
This renderer was a collaboration between Yosi Schlakman and Eli Howitt made for the Software Engineering course final project.
